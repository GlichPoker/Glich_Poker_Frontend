# Glitch Poker Frontend

---

## Introduction

**Glitch Poker** is an online poker application focused on delivering a **customizable and social poker experience**. Our goal is to provide a platform where users can enjoy classic poker with the flexibility to add custom rules, weather-based effects, and social features like friends and chat.

Only **authenticated users** can join games, create lobbies, and challenge friends directly. Lobby creators have the power to define custom rules, adjust hand rankings, and even apply special rules based on real-world weather. We built Glitch Poker to offer a more diverse and enjoyable poker experience than existing platforms.
