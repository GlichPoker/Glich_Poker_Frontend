# Glitch Poker Frontend

## Introduction

**Glitch Poker** is an online poker application focused on delivering a **customizable poker experience**. Our goal is to provide a platform where users can enjoy classic poker with the flexibility to add custom rules, experience weather-based maps with special actions and use social features like friends and chat.

Only **authenticated users** can join games, create lobbies and challange friends. Lobby creators have the power to define custom rules, adjust hand rankings, and even apply special rules based on real-world weather. We built Glitch Poker to offer a more versatile poker experience than existing platforms.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** 
  * React with Next.js framework
  * TypeScript 
  * Ant Design component library for UI elements
  * Tailwind CSS for styling
* **State & Data:** 
  * REST API for data fetching and updates
  * WebSockets for real-time game events and chat
* **Special Features:**
  * Integration of weather API for dynamic game environments
  * Deck of Cards API for card visualization

## High-Level Components

* **Lobby Management:** Handles the creation, listing, and joining of game lobbies.

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
3.  **Build for production:**
    ```sh
    npm run build
    npm start
    ```

3. Create Lobby
   * When creating a lobby, the player can select custom rules.
   * Based on the host's location, the weather and weather-based rules are automatically applied.(Players can change weather-based rules through voting.) There is also a default map for normal rounds of poker without weather based rules.
   * The host is able to create public or privat lobbies. Private lobbies can only be accessed by entering the correct password or by an invitation by the lobby leader.

4. In-game
   * The players are able to use nomal poker actions and special actions, which are determined by the map type.
   * The image of the game table switches according to the predetermined weather.
   * A maximum of 5 players can play in one lobby at the same time.
